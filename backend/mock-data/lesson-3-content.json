      "content": "What Are React Components?\\n\\nReact components are the building blocks of a React application.\\nEach component represents a small, independent, and reusable part of the user interface — like buttons, forms, menus, or entire pages.\\n\\nYou can think of them like LEGO pieces:\\neach one is self-contained, but together they create a full, interactive application.\\n\\n🧠 Main Ideas\\n\\nReusability – A component can be used in many places without rewriting it.\\nExample: one \\\"Button\\\" component might appear on several screens.\\n\\nModularity – The app is split into small, manageable pieces instead of one big file.\\nThis makes it easier to maintain and understand.\\n\\nComposition – Components can contain other components.\\nFor instance, a \\\"Page\\\" component might include a \\\"Header\\\", \\\"Sidebar\\\", and \\\"Footer\\\".\\n\\nData Flow – Data usually flows from parent to child through something called props (short for properties).\\nThis allows customization of each component's behavior and appearance.\\n\\nState Management – Components can have their own state, meaning they can remember information, react to user actions, and update the screen automatically.\\n\\nDeclarative Nature – Instead of manually changing the page, you describe what the UI should look like at any moment, and React updates it for you.\\n\\nLifecycle – Each component has a \\\"life cycle\\\": it is created, updated when data changes, and removed when no longer needed.\\n\\n💡 Why Components Are Powerful\\n\\nThey make development faster and cleaner.\\n\\nThey encourage consistent design and logic.\\n\\nThey simplify debugging and testing.\\n\\nThey enable teamwork — different developers can work on different components.",
